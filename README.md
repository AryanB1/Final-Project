# Final-Project
## What is the Project?
- This project is a pong game ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong))
- This project is written in the processing language ([Processing Documentation](https://processing.org/reference))
## Purpose and Personal Interest 
- **Purpose:** To demonstrate my knowledge in the processing language and understanding of object orientated programming principles alongside other curricular outcomes of advanced computer science
- **Personal Interest:** My personal interest in completing this project is because after writing and rewriting pong so many times in class, I wanted to finish this course with the best version of pong that I could create
## Features and Easter Eggs
-All basic features of pong gone over in class
-Additional 
## Unfinished Features
- Full Android Support: At the moment, only a few key features are available through mousePressed, with many features still utilizing keyPressed. For a full port to the Android operating system, touch screen support needs to be added to the following features: Paddle Movement, paddle speed settings, ball speed settings, multiplayer vs singleplayer vs screensaver, and nightmode vs daymode.
- Online Multiplayer Support: Use computer networking principles and webhosting to allow for online multiplayer pong games.
- Different Background Themes and Theme Selection: Allow the user to select a background to play pong on such as a tennis court, a badminton court, or a table tennis table.
