# Final-Project
## What is the Project?
- This project is a pong game ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong))
- This project is written in the processing language ([Processing Documentation](https://processing.org/reference))
## Purpose and Personal Interest 
- **Purpose:** To demonstrate my knowledge in the processing language and understanding of object orientated programming principles alongside other curricular outcomes of advanced computer science
- **Personal Interest:** My personal interest in completing this project is because after writing and rewriting pong so many times in class, I wanted to finish this course with the best version of pong that I could create
## Features and Easter Eggs
- All basic features of pong gone over in class
- Easter Eggs: If the left score and right score equal to three a special interaction occurs
- Additional Features: If one player wins they recieve a celebration of circles
- When a goal is scored a small piece of the goal scoarers paddle falls off to make it fair, and the screen shows a message congratulation the player for scoring
- There are buttons for starting the game, exiting the game (while the game is on instructions mode, and when the screen mode is in portrait), and restarting the game (while the game is being played, and when the game is won)
- Although buttons are present in the game, all keypress commands are still available, as if the user does not have a mouse, using a trackpad to click buttons can be inconvienient 
## Unfinished Features
- Full Android Support: At the moment, only a few key features are available through mousePressed, with many features still utilizing keyPressed. For a full port to the Android operating system, touch screen support needs to be added to the following features: Paddle Movement, paddle speed settings, ball speed settings, multiplayer vs singleplayer vs screensaver, and nightmode vs daymode.
- Online Multiplayer Support: Use computer networking principles and webhosting to allow for online multiplayer pong games.
- Different Background Themes and Theme Selection: Allow the user to select a background to play pong on such as a tennis court, a badminton court, or a table tennis table.
